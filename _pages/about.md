I’m a Digital Insights Analyst cutting my teeth at MYOB, a fintech SaaS company located in Melbourne, Australia. Before diving into the world of data, I was a Performance Marketing Specialist at Country Road Group with a passion for web analytics.

A few things about me;

* Results driven and enjoy building things – revenue, growth, products. I want to move the metrics and make recommendations that will assist in delivering business objectives.
* Insights driven and approach problems with an analytical and experimental based methodology.
* Enjoy statistical programming in R and regularly use libraries such as `tidyverse`. Some of my favourite libraries are `googleanalyticsR` and `prophet`.
* Using AWS Athena and BigQuery for analysis and data manipulation. I'm experienced with SQL and relational databases. For example, writing SQL queries and transformations, putting them into Airflow DAGs to run on schedule to prepare them for a presentation layer.
* Experience with GCP. I regularly use products such as Cloud Functions, BigQuery, Google Cloud Storage, Pub/Sub, Cloud Source Repository, Stackdriver. For example, creating ETL data flows to send data to S3 using all of these services.
* Experienced using Segment as a CDP for all event capture. Building Personas to send cohorts to other destinations (ie. media buying tools and other analytics services)
* Currently learning Django and heavily interested in big data, machine learning and predictive analytics.
* Employing good software engineering practices using `git ` and clean code principles.

I’m a Digital Insights Analyst cutting my teeth at MYOB, a fintech SaaS company located in Melbourne, Australia. Before diving into the world of data, I was a Performance Marketing Specialist at Country Road Group with a passion for web analytics.

A few things about me;

* Results driven and enjoy building things – revenue, growth, products. I want to move the metrics that will assist in delivering business objectives.
* Insights driven and approach problems with an analytical and experimental based methodology.
* Enjoy statistical programming (R) and regularly use libraries such as `googleanalyticsR` and `prophet`.
* Using AWS Athena to run SQL queries a whole heap of data sitting in S3.
* Currently learning python and heavily interested in big data, machine learning and predictive analytics.
